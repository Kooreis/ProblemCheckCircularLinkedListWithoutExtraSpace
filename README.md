# Question: How do you check whether a linked list is circular without extra space? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code checks whether a linked list is circular without using extra space. It does this by implementing Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and the hare" algorithm. The algorithm works by creating two pointers, one that moves at a slower pace (one step at a time, referred to as the "tortoise") and another that moves at a faster pace (two steps at a time, referred to as the "hare"). The pointers start at the head of the linked list and move through the list. If the linked list is circular, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer, indicating a cycle. If the linked list is not circular, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list without meeting the slow pointer. The function returns true if a cycle is detected and false otherwise.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more structured and object-oriented than the JavaScript version. It uses classes and type annotations, which are features not available in JavaScript.

1. Classes: TypeScript version uses classes (Node and LinkedList) to structure the code. This makes the code more readable and maintainable. The JavaScript version uses a function constructor to create Node objects.

2. Type Annotations: TypeScript version uses type annotations to ensure that variables are of the correct type. For example, the `value` property of the Node class is annotated as a number, and the `next` property is annotated as either a Node or null. This helps to catch type-related errors at compile time.

3. Methods: The TypeScript version includes an `append` method in the LinkedList class to add new nodes to the list, and an `isCircular` method to check if the list is circular. The JavaScript version does not have these methods and requires manual linking of nodes.

4. Null Checks: TypeScript version uses `fast && fast.next` in the while loop condition to check if `fast` and `fast.next` are not null. This is a more concise way to check for null values compared to the JavaScript version, which uses `fast !== null && fast.next !== null`.

Overall, the TypeScript version is more robust and easier to understand and maintain due to its use of classes, methods, and type annotations.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution also uses Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, but it is implemented slightly differently. Instead of using two pointers that move at different speeds, it uses a single pointer that starts at the second node in the list and checks at each step whether it has returned to the head of the list. If it does, the list is circular. If it reaches a null pointer (the end of the list), the list is not circular.

The C++ version uses a struct to define the Node, which is similar to the JavaScript version's use of a function constructor to define the Node. However, in C++, the Node struct includes a data field and a next pointer, while in JavaScript, the Node function constructor includes a value field and a next field that defaults to null.

The C++ version also includes a helper function, newNode, to create new nodes. This function is not present in the JavaScript version, which uses the new keyword and the Node function constructor to create new nodes.

In terms of language features, the C++ version uses pointers to navigate the linked list, while the JavaScript version uses object references. The C++ version also uses the new keyword to allocate memory for new nodes, while the JavaScript version does not need to explicitly allocate memory.

The C++ version uses the iostream library for console output, while the JavaScript version uses the console.log function. The C++ version also includes a main function, which is the entry point of the program, while the JavaScript version does not have a main function.
